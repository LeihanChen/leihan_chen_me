This is not a poem reflected to the patriarchal example in the book *五燈會元*. The sentiment of this poem, however, is strongly mixed with my persoanl life experience and feeling, which totally alleviates the orginal spirit in the example. The poem is written in 17th Decemebr 2018. After two years, when I recalled this naive poem, that strong sentiment came back, although in an unavoidable recession. 

**你和我**                                                  
黑貓去山頂探望佛祖的弟子。  
室外一片片葉子都渴求陽光，  
室內檀木桌上的奩盒也保持沈默，  
它們都已完成自己的目標。  
趙州把放在頭上的鞋履重新穿上，  
河的中央，  
少女走過了石橋。  

**You and Me**  
The black cat went to the top of the mountain,  
visiting the disciple of Buddha.  
Every leaf outside the room seeks for the sunshine,
The cosmetic box on the desk inside the room also keeps silence,
All of them achieve their respective goal.
Zhaozhou redresses the shoes that is put on the head,
In the middle of river,
A maiden has crossed the stone bridge.
